# Auto-Deployment ML Models â€” Project Summary# Auto-Deployment ML Models - Project Summary



## Overview## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

This repository implements a CLI-first MLOps pipeline focused on training, validating, and using machine learning models via command-line tools. The project is intentionally lightweight and designed to be adapted into larger deployment flows if desired.

This repository implements a CLI-first MLOps pipeline focused on training, validating, and using machine learning models via command-line tools. The project has been refactored to be lightweight, automation-friendly, and easy to integrate into CI pipelines. It intentionally avoids embedding a serving API or monitoring stack so those concerns can be added separately.

## âœ… Completed Components

## What this project provides

### 1. Machine Learning Pipeline

- A training script (`src/train_model.py`) that trains a scikit-learn classifier (example RandomForest), saves the model and metadata, and writes a `latest_model.json` pointer.- Model training: example RandomForest trainer with configurable model name/version

- A validation script (`src/validate_model.py`) that loads any saved model and its metadata, evaluates it on test data, performs cross-validation, and emits a JSON validation report.- Data generation: synthetic dataset generator for quick experiments

- A prediction script (`src/predict.py`) that loads a saved model and returns a JSON prediction for provided features.- Model validation: comprehensive validation checks and cross-validation

- A pytest-based test suite that verifies training, validation, prediction, and CLI workflows.- Model persistence: models and metadata are saved under `models/`



## Key project artifacts### 2. CLI Tools

- `src/train_model.py` â€” train a model (supports CLI args and interactive prompts)

- `models/` â€” contains trained `.pkl` files, metadata JSON, and validation reports- `src/validate_model.py` â€” validate a saved model (`--model`)

- `data/dataset.csv` â€” sample dataset used for training and validation (generated if missing)- `src/predict.py` â€” make predictions from a saved model (`--model --features`)

- `src/` â€” core scripts: training, validation, prediction, and utilities

- `tests/` â€” unit and integration tests### 3. Testing

- Pytest-based test suite covering training, validation, prediction, and CLI workflows

## Usage highlights

## ðŸ“ˆ Demonstration Results (example)

- Train: `python src/train_model.py --model-name <name> --version <x.y.z>`

- Validate: `python src/validate_model.py --model models/<name>_v<x.y.z>.pkl````

- Predict: `python src/predict.py --model models/<name>_v<x.y.z>.pkl --features 1.0 2.0 ...`Training: completed successfully, model saved to models/ml_classifier_v1.0.0.pkl

Validation: MODEL VALIDATION PASSED - report saved to models/validation_report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json

Notes:Prediction: Prediction: {"prediction": 1, "probability": [0.3, 0.7], "model_version": "1.0.0"}

- `train_model.py` is interactive when run in a TTY: it lists existing models and allows choosing one to overwrite or entering a new name/version. Non-interactive runs use CLI defaults, which keeps CI and tests deterministic.```

- Metadata files include `feature_names` and `metrics` â€” keep this structure if you replace the trainer.

## ðŸ—‚ Project Structure

## Recent changes (refactor summary)

```

- Removed API/server files and monitoring stacks to focus on a CLI-first workflow.Devops_Project/

- Updated scripts to accept model paths and to avoid hard-coded model names.â”œâ”€â”€ src/

- Rewrote tests to use `subprocess` CLI invocations; all tests pass locally.â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ train_model.py

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ validate_model.py

## Next steps and suggested improvementsâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ predict.py

â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils.py

1. Replace the example training code with your real training pipeline and ensure metadata compatibility.â”œâ”€â”€ models/

2. Add optional containerization and CI templates in separate folders (keeps the core CLI small).â”œâ”€â”€ data/

3. Add a lightweight serving wrapper if you need an API â€” separate from CLI scripts.â”œâ”€â”€ tests/

4. Integrate artifact storage (S3, GCS) if you need remote model storage.â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt

## Quick Start

1. Create and activate a Python virtual environment (platform-specific)
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Train a model (defaults used when non-interactive):

```bash
python src/train_model.py
```

4. Validate a model:

```bash
python src/validate_model.py --model models/ml_classifier_v1.0.0.pkl
```

5. Make a prediction:

```bash
python src/predict.py --model models/ml_classifier_v1.0.0.pkl --features 1.0 2.0 3.0 ...
```

6. Run tests:

```bash
pytest
```

## Obsolete / Removed

- API/server code and docs have been removed â€” this repo now focuses on CLI tooling.
- Docker, Prometheus, and monitoring stacks are not included in the updated workspace.

## Next Steps

1. Integrate with your CI/CD system if you want automated builds/deployments
2. Add containerization or orchestration when moving to production
3. Replace the example trainer with your production model and dataset
